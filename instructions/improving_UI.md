### **Homepage**
1. **Hero Section**
   - The current UI of the hero section is fine and does not need changes.
2. **Below Hero Section**
   - Address the empty white space below the hero section by:
     - Adding a footer with useful links, or
     - Expanding the content below the hero section to eliminate the white space.
3. **Redirect for Logged-in Users**
   - Implement redirection:
     - If a user is logged in and visits the homepage, they should automatically be redirected to the dashboard page.

### **Dashboard**
1. **Header Navigation**
   - Update the header to include the following items:
     - **Dashboard**
     - **Event Types**
     - **Availability**
   - Remove the left-side navigation bar for these items.
2. **Page Title**
   - Remove the title **Overview** from the dashboard as it becomes redundant.
3. **Main Screen Tabs**
   - Add two tabs to the main screen:
     - **Event Types**
     - **Scheduled Events**
   - Allow users to switch between these tabs on the main dashboard screen.
4. **Event Types Section**
   - Relocate the "Create Event Type" button:
     - Place it next to the event type cards in the form of a button the same size as the event type cards, with just a "+" icon in the center.
     - Remove the "Create Event Type" button from the large blue header element.
5. **Scheduled Events Section**
   - Fix the bug where the **Scheduled Events** section is not showing any content.

### **Event Types Page**
1. **General Functionality**
   - The page functions well and does not require any structural or UI changes.
2. **Meeting Location Dropdown**
   - Add a dropdown menu for selecting the meeting location when editing an event type:
     - Allow users to choose between "Google Meet" or a "Physical Location."
     - Integrate this into the popup that appears when someone clicks the "Edit" button.

### **Availability Page**
#### Description of the Desired UI
The **Weekly Availability** section should be modeled after the following detailed description:
1. **Layout and Sections**
   - The section includes two columns:
     - **Left Column:** Displays weekly availability with each day listed vertically (Monday to Sunday) and associated time intervals.
     - **Right Column:** Displays a "Date-Specific Hours" section for setting unique availability for specific dates.
2. **Weekly Availability Details**
   - Each day includes:
     - A checkbox or toggle to enable/disable availability for that day.
     - A time interval displayed as "Start - End" (e.g., 09:00 - 17:00).
     - A "Copy" icon for duplicating the time interval to other days.
   - The time intervals are editable and visually aligned in a simple list format.
3. **Date-Specific Hours**
   - This section allows users to add availability for specific dates:
     - A button labeled "Add Date-Specific Hours" to set one-off availability.
4. **Popup for Editing Availability**
   - When a user edits a day’s availability:
     - A popup appears with fields for "Start" and "End" times in dropdown format.
     - A "Mark as Unavailable" toggle is included for disabling availability on that day.
     - An "Add New Interval" button lets users add multiple availability intervals for the same day.

#### Feedback for Changes:
1. **Time Zone Settings**
   - Move the **Time Zone Settings** to the bottom of the page, as users rarely modify this option.
2. **Weekly Hours**
   - Keep the weekly availability section at the top of the page.
   - Ensure the layout mirrors the described UI reference:
     - Days listed vertically with time intervals editable via dropdowns.
     - Include the "Copy" icon for duplicating availability to other days.
3. **Date-Specific Hours**
   - Retain the **Date-Specific Hours** section on the right, with a button for adding custom hours.
4. **UI Improvements**
   - Ensure the **Weekly Availability** section looks clean, aligned, and intuitive, as per the description above.
5. **Popup UI**
   - For editing a day’s availability, ensure the popup includes:
     - Dropdowns for "Start" and "End" times.
     - An "Add New Interval" button for adding multiple time slots.
     - A toggle option for "Mark as Unavailable."
